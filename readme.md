# Tiny world

Small project to learn basic GUI and a reinforcement learning in a simulated world.

## Requirements
1. The world is a grid of NxM,
2. The world is populated by the following Beings: Source, Prey and Predator.
3. Source grows spontaneously with a certain rate in a random place.
4. Prey eats Source.
5. When Prey eats Source it reproduces creating a new Prey Being.
6. Predator eats Prey.
7. When Predator eats Prey it reproduces creating a new Predator Being.
8. Both Predator and Prey die and disappear after certain times t1, t2 without eating.
9. Both Predator and Prey have a finite field of view.
10. Implement a reinforcement learning algorithm that allows the beings to learn how to get food.
11. Implement a GUI that allows to visualize the world and interact with it.
