# Tiny world

Small project to learn basic GUI and a reinforcement learning in a simulated world.

## Requirements
1. The world is a grid of NxM,
2. The world is populated by beings A, B and C.
3. C grows spontaneously with a certain rate in a random place in a random maner.
4. A eats C.
5. When A eats C it reproduces creating a new A being.
6. B eats A.
7. When B eats A it reproduces creating a new B being.
8. Both A and B die and disappear after certain times t1, t2 without eating.
9. Both A and B have a finite field of view.
10. Implement a reinforcement learning algorithm that allows the beings to learn how to get food.
11. Implement a GUI that allows to visualize the world and interact with it.
